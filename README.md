## Description
A SQL assignment is given to computer science students at some point during their academic journey, which requires them to write SQL queries and run them against the database. Any instance of the database schema must match the SQL queries. 

The aim of this project is to develop a system that simplify the tasks of Course Convenors when it comes to creating and marking SQL statements. The system will consist of a number of databases. As a result, a set of assignments will be generated, one for each student in the class - the assignment given to each student will be determined by their student number. Students will be given a fixed number of generated questions in each assignment, divided equally across difficulty levels for each assignment. The system will accept student submissions (lists of SQL SELECT statements) and provide a mark as well as an indication of how their output differs from what was expected. The mark for each student is stored for every assignment.
